<h1 id="icpc-reference">ICPC Reference</h1>
<p>The International Collegiate Programming Contest is the most prestigious programming contest ever; competing in it requires a lot of effort and dedication, and one of the first things you should do is a * reference *, so even though it wasnâ€™t the first thing I did, this is the place where I upload all my algorithms that I use for ICPC type contests.</p>
<p>Feel free to use any of the codes whenever and wherever you need them.</p>
